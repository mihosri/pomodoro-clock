# Challenges and Success

- This work was so challenging interms of setting the state back when the session or break ends. Also it involved a lot of functionalities. Separating into components and having functions for separate actions helped.

# Future Improvements

- Adding Doc
- Fixing the loop between break and time session
- Clean code
- Pass all test cases

# Learnings

- Fixed a bug by replacing the variable name from break (keyword) to breakTime
- Handling time

# Deployed App Link
